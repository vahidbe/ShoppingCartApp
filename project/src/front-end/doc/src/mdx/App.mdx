# App
The main component that hosts the shopping cart application and orchestrates which Web page users may see on their Web browsers. Two components form a web page:

- `<FlashMessages />` banner with some informative messages
- And only one of the following components:
  - `<AdminForm />` administrator page to update the catalog of products
    - Users may access this page with the route `/admin`
  - `<RegisterForm />` form to create a user account
  - `<LoginForm />` log in page
  - `<ShoppingCartApp />` application main page, only authenticated users are allowed to perform purchases

Take a look at the `App.render()` method to see how the different web pages are shown.

In a nutshell, `App` uses its state (`App.state`) to allow authenticated users perform purchases and restrict anonymous users (non authenticated users) only to consult the catalog of products (source file: `front-end/src/App.jsx`).

## **Properties**
This section contains a brief description of instance attributes and instance methods in an `App` component.
<Props of={App} />

## **Note for improvements**
Changes in `App` may impact the content of web pages or the order in which such pages appear. **Refer to the component `<ShoppingCartApp />` to improve the shopping cart application or make calls to other micro-services from this front-end.**
